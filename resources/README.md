# Resources

This directory has the resources for the project.

## Icons

[The icons set was created by Geovanny Gavilanes](https://www.iconfinder.com/iconsets/151-1)

## Database

When you are creating the ERC721 contract for your PokeToken you will need a database in order to save the metadata of your NFTs. Here we present to you 2 simple solutions:

1- By default, you will use [this Metadata API](https://cryptopokes.herokuapp.com/) that was created using [this repository](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/metadata-api-nodejs), but you can create your own Metadata API following [this tutorial](https://github.com/ProjectOpenSea/metadata-api-nodejs#readme). The database files for moves and tokens are available in the [dbs section](https://github.com/Obalfour/CryptoPokes/tree/main/resources/dbs).

2- If you don't want to deploy a full Metadata API server you can use [My JSON Server](https://my-json-server.typicode.com/) to create a Fake Online REST server with [this sample_db.json](https://github.com/Obalfour/CryptoPokes/blob/main/resources/dbs/sample_db.json).

## Documentation

An article written by Agust√≠n Golmar, Ariel Atar and Oliver Balfour is available in the docs section and also [in Medium](https://oliver-balfour.medium.com/chainlink-the-decentralized-oracle-70f3bc95007b) together with a presentation.
